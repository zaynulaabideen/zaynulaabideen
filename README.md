# My Web

HTML5 Boilerplate is a professional front-end template for building
fast, robust, and adaptable web apps or sites.

This project is the product of over 10 years of iterative development and
community knowledge. It does not impose a specific development
philosophy or framework, so you're free to architect your code in the
way that you want.

## About This Repository

This repository is where HTML5-Boilerplate is authored. Some of the tools,
files and processes that you see here are solely for the _production_ of
HTML5 Boilerplate and are not _part_ of HTML5 Boilerplate. For one example, the
[gulpfile.mjs](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/main/gulpfile.mjs)
script is used to _build_ the project. It's not part of the project itself.

The project we publish is represented by the contents of the `/dist/`
folder. Everything else in this repository is used to author the project.

Think of it this way, in the same way that you don't clone [vuejs/core](https://github.com/vuejs/core)
to create a Vue.js app, you don't need to clone this repository to start a new
site or app based on HTML5 Boilerplate.

So, if you're looking for a quick start template to build a web site or
application, look at the options in the
[Quick Start](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate#quick-start) section of this document.

If you want to help us _improve_ HTML5 Boilerplate then you can start with the documentation [here](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), which includes steps to clone this repo in order to get it set up for development.
